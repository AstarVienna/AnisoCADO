Getting Started
===============

The basics
----------
The core of AnisoCADO is centred around the :class:`AnalyticalScaoPsf` object.
When created it runs a series of setup routines, including creating a PSF
kernel based on the parameters it is passed during the initialisation. This
original PSF kernel is valid for the on-sky coordinate of the natural guide star
(NGS) used to drive the AO correction. It is the "optimal" PSF, and can always
be called up using ``.psf_on_axis``

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    from anisocado import AnalyticalScaoPsf

    psf = AnalyticalScaoPsf(N=512, wavelength=2.15)  # um
    kernel = psf.psf_on_axis

.. plot::
    :context:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
    plt.imshow(kernel, origin="l", norm=LogNorm())


The Strehl ratio of this kernel can be found by calling::

    psf.strehl_ratio

The quality of the AO correction reduces as one moves away from the guide star.
To sample the PSF at a specific distance from the guide star (i.e. off axis),
use the method :meth:`~AnalyticalScaoPsf.shift_off_axis`. AnisoCADO
calculates a new PSF kernel for this coordinate, which is both returned by the
function, and stored internally in `.psf_latest`

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    kernel = psf.shift_off_axis(15, -5)   # arcsec
    # saved for later under:
    kernel = psf.psf_latest

.. plot::
    :context:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
    plt.imshow(kernel, origin="l", norm=LogNorm())


The returned ``kernel`` object is a numpy array. However AnisoCADO also produces
a FITS HDU object from the ``psf_latest`` array when ``.hdu`` is called::

    image_hdu = psf.hdu

``image_hdu`` is an :class:`~astropy.io.fits.ImageHDU` object, and can therefore
be saved to disk using the standard ``astropy`` method ``.writeto``::

    image_hdu.writeto("new_scao_psf.fits")


Example: Off-axis Stehl ratios
------------------------------

As an example of using the AnisoCADO API, let's determine the Strehl ratio for
different wavelengths as we move away from the (on-axis) guide star for the
atmospheric profile ``EsoMedian``

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    sr_list = {}
    wave_list = [0.87, 1.05, 1.25, 1.65, 2.15]
    for wave in wave_list:
        sr_list[wave] = []

        # Generate a PSF object for wavelength `wave` in um
        psf = AnalyticalScaoPsf(N=512, wavelength=wave, profile_name="EsoMedian")

        # Shift the PSF to different distances from the NGS
        off_axis_positions = range(0, 41, 2)
        for x in off_axis_positions:
            psf.shift_off_axis(x, 0)
            sr_list[wave] += [psf.strehl_ratio]

To plot the results

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    for wave in wave_list:
        plt.plot(off_axis_positions, sr_list[wave], label="{} um".format(wave))

    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel("Distance from NGS [arcsec]")
    plt.ylabel("Strehl Ratio")
    plt.xlim(0, 30)


In-built atmospheric profiles
-----------------------------

AnisoCADO uses a 35-layer description of the atmospheric turbulence to generate
the PSFs. By default AnisoCADO contains 3 sets of values for the turbulence,
based on the ESO-258292 document. A turbulence profiles can be set by changing
the parameter ``profile_name`` of the ``AnalyticalScaoPsf`` object::

    psf = anisocado.AnalyticalScaoPsf(profile_name="EsoMedian")
    # or
    psf.profile_name = "EsoMedian"

Alternatively we could set out own atmospheric turbulence profile if we had
our own Cn2 information::

    psf.layerAltitude = [0.1, 5, 12]    # km
    psf.Cn2h = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]          # relative amount of turbulence


The main 3 atmospheric profiles provided are list in the table below:

=========== =========== ======= =========== ======= ===============
Name        Conditions  Seeing  Zenith      Wind    Turbulence
                                Distance    Speed   Profile
----------- ----------- ------- ----------- ------- ---------------
                        arcsec  degree      m/s     Rel Cn2
=========== =========== ======= =========== ======= ===============
EsoQ1       Good        0.4     0           8.8     ESO Quartile 1
EsoMedian   Median      0.67    30          10      ESO Median

=========== =========== ======= =========== ======= ===============

.. plot::

    from anisocado.psf_utils import get_atmospheric_turbulence

    plt.clf()
    for profile, clr, alpha in zip(["EsoQ1", "EsoMedian", "EsoQ4"],
                                    "gyr", [0.88, 1, 1.3]):
        h, Cn2 = get_atmospheric_turbulence(profile)
        plt.plot(Cn2 * alpha, h, clr, label=profile)
    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel("Relative turbulence strength")
    plt.ylabel("Height [km]")
    plt.semilogy()


Creating a field-varying PSF FITS file for SimCADO
--------------------------------------------------

AnisoCADO is able to create PSF files in the format needed by SimCADO. The
function ``anisocado.misc.make_simcado_psf_file`` handles most of the
nitty-gritty. We just need to provide positions relative to the centre of the
field of view where the PSF should be evaluated, and the wavelength at which
this should be done.

To start the example, let's create a list of coordinates at 45 degree intervals
around concentric circles at increasing radii::

    # include the centre of the FOV
    coords = [(0, 0)]
    radii = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 23, 31]
    for radius in :
        for ang in np.arange(0, 360, 45):
            coords += [(radius * np.cos(np.deg2rad(ang)),
                        radius * np.sin(np.deg2rad(ang)))]

To make life easier, this code in :mod:`anisocado.misc`::

    anisocado.misc.field_positions_for_simcado_psf(radii=radii, theta=45)

Now we just need to decide which wavelengths to add. The function
`Â´make_simcado_psf_file`` expects the wavelengths to be in micron [um]. Let's
take the central wavelengths for the 5 major broad-band filters of MICADO::

    waves = [0.87, 1.05, 1.25, 1.65, 2.15]

We generate a fits.HDUList object by passing these to list to
``make_simcado_psf_file``::

    from anisocado import misc
    hdu = misc.make_simcado_psf_file(coords, waves)
    hdu.writeto("my_new_fv_psf.fits")

By default AnisoCADO will create 512 x 512 pixel PSF kernels with a pixel size
of 4mas. If we want to change this we can pass the parameters accepted by
``anisocado.psf.AnalyticalScaoPsf`` as kwargs::

    hdu = misc.make_simcado_psf_file(coords, waves, pixelSize=0.0015, N=1024)


Setting atmospheric parameters
------------------------------

A full list of attributes can be found in the docstring for
:class:`AnalyticalScaoPsf`. The ones most likely to be of interest to the casual
user are given below. They can all be referenced and set in the following
manner::

    psf = anisocado.AnalyticalScaoPsf()
    psf.profile_name = "EsoQ1"
    psf.wavelength = 2.15    # um


**Settable Attributes**::

    profile_name : str
        ['EsoQ1', 'EsoMedian', 'EsoQ4', 'oldEso', 'gendron']. Default: EsoMedian
        Names of specific atmospheric conditions for which presets exist.
        See :func:`psf_utils.get_atmospheric_turbulence`
    N : int
        [pixel] Default: 512 pixel. Side-length of the kernel array
    wavelength : float
        [um] Default: 2.15 um. Wavelength for which the PSF should be generated

The following parameters can be set by the user, but if they are left blank,
AnisoCADO will fill them in based on the chosen ``profile_name``. As with the
normal attributes, there are many more derived attributes which the user can
override. See :class:`AnalyticalScaoPsf`.

**Derived Attributes if not set by the user**::

    seeing : float
        [arcsec] Default: 0.67 arcsec. Set by profile_name, if not set by user
    zenDist : float
        [degree] Default: 30 deg. Zenith distance. Set by profile_name, if not
        set by user
